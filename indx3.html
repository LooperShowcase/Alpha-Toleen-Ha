      <h3>History of Apple Inc. 1976–1980:</h3>
      <p>
        History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his
        parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California. Although it is
        widely believed that the company was founded in the house's garage,
        Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called it "a bit of a myth". Jobs and
        Wozniak did, however, move some operations to the garage when the
        bedroom became too crowded.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apple's first product, the Apple I, designed by Steve Wozniak, was sold
        as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a
        keyboard, monitor, and case. The owner of this unit added a keyboard and
        wooden case. The Apple II Plus, introduced in 1979, designed primarily
        by Wozniak. Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by
        Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership. The
        company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and
        hand-built entirely by Wozniak. To finance its creation, Jobs sold his
        Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer
        Club in July 1976. The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM,
        and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be
        marketed as a complete personal computer. It went on sale soon after
        debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).
